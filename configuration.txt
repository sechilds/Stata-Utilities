University of Ottawa Institutional Data -- Retention Project

File created 26APR2011.

	1. Upon checking this file out of the repository, switch to the main
directory and run configure.do in Stata. This Stata do file with walk
you through setting up a user_locals.do file that controls where all the
included programs will store logs and data files. user_locals.do files
are ignored by git. If there is an existing user_locals.do file, a
backup will be created. (The backup is also ignored by git.)

	2. In order to ensure that data does not get committed to the git
repository, the configuration program will add the paths of the data
directory files to the .gitignore file. (A backup of the .gitignore file
will be created.) These changes will need to be committed to the repository.

	3. In order to run many of the table display programs, you must
compile some mata code by running master_mata.do.
